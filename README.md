Deck Collector 
I built this porject so that you can add your own collection of decks and maybe learn a little bit more about MTG

simple One Page application where user can navigate to 2 different components 
on load user will be taken to Home component where there is a bit of history and some basic rules on how to play

The Colors component when user clicks on Color in navbar they will send user to a color page which has each color of magic what they represent and some play style

The decks  component, when user clicks on the Decks and Sleeves it will take you to a page where you can display your sleeves and add sleeves as well


HOW TO RUN

1 - run npm i to install dependencies
2- run the server which is this command line "json-server --watch db.json " (note please use npm ver 18. or higher ) 
3- npm start to run the page
